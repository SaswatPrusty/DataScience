    "policy focused on advancing America's core national interests -- so important -- promoting regional stability and producing and easing the tensions within our very troubled world. This will require rethinking the failed policies of the past. We can make new friends, rebuild old alliances and bring new allies into the fold. And we can do that. I'm proud to have the support of war-fighting generals, active duty military and top experts who know both how to win and how to avoid endless wars that we're caught up in, like the one we have right now that just never ever ends, our longest war. Just yesterday, 88 top generals and admirals endorsed my campaign. And these people are fantastic. <APPLAUSE>\n",
    "<TRUMP:> In a Trump administration, our actions in the Middle East will be tempered by realism. The current \n",
    "strategy of toppling regimes with no plan for what to do in the day after only produces power vacuums that are \n",
    "filled simply by terrorists. Gradual reform, not sudden and radical change, should be our guiding objective in \n",

    "We now have an administration and a former secretary of State who refuse to say radical Islamic terrorism. And \n",
    "unless you're going to say the words, you're never going to solve the problem. It's very simple. <APPLAUSE>\n",
    "<TRUMP:> Immediately after taking office, I will ask my generals to present to me a plan, within 30 days, \n",
    "to defeat and destroy ISIS. <APPLAUSE>\n",
    "<TRUMP:> This will require military warfare, but also cyber warfare, financial warfare and ideological warfare, \n",

    "which you saw President Obama give over and over again, I will proudly promote our system of government and our \n",

    "legacy in Iraq, Libya, Syria has produced only turmoil and suffering and death. Her destructive \n",

    "Had we done nothing, we would have been in a far better position. \n",

    "belligerent than ever. Russia has defied this administration at every single turn. \n",
    "Putin has no respect for President Obama and has absolutely no respect for Hillary Clinton. \n",
    "Sometimes it seemed like there wasn't a country in the Middle East that Hillary Clinton didn't want to invade, \n",
